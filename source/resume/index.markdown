Personal Projects
-----------------

[__txsockjs__](http://github.com/DesertBus/sockjs-twisted)

A library that allows any existing Twisted Python server to accept connections straight from web browsers through the websocket polyfill, [SockJS](http://github.com/sockjs/sockjs-client).
Also works well with websites written for Twisted Web.

[__txircd__](http://github.com/DesertBus/txircd)

A fully featured IRC server written in Twisted Python that attempts to make it as easy to make your own IRC network as it is to make an IRC bot.
It is currently being refactored to be more modular, and to support server to server connections.

[__Sburb__](http://github.com/WhatPumpkin/Sburb)

A 2D walkaround game engine designed to allow creators to easily create interactive RPG-like games to further their stories.
All assets and dialogue are defined in XML for ease of use; the storyteller doesn't have to touch any code at all.
I primarily worked on the asset loading code, making the progress bar more meaningful, and the loading code more resiliant to server failures.
This allowed the game to fail less when the asset server is under high load, as it often was for the primary games created with the engine.
